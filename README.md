A first-person adventure game built in Unity, “Mysterious Jungle: The Lost Treasure” takes players deep into an uncharted jungle in search of hidden riches. All 3D assets were custom-created in Blender. The game focuses on exploration, immersion, and puzzle-solving to uncover the long-lost treasure.
